For completeness, those operations are dynamic errors:

  ASL Dynamic error: Illegal application of operator DIV for values 6 and -3.
  [1]

  $ aslref dynamic-divrm-neg.asl
  ASL Dynamic error: Illegal application of operator DIVRM for values 6 and -3.
  [1]

  $ aslref dynamic-mod-neg.asl

  [1]

  $ aslref dynamic-div-zero.asl
  ASL Dynamic error: Illegal application of operator DIV for values 6 and 0.
  [1]

  $ aslref dynamic-divrm-zero.asl
  ASL Dynamic error: Illegal application of operator DIVRM for values 6 and 0.
  [1]

  $ aslref dynamic-mod-zero.asl
  ASL Dynamic error: Illegal application of operator MOD for values 6 and 0.
  [1]

  $ aslref dynamic-div-undiv.asl

More complicated examples
=========================

Fails because N typing cannot infer that N + 1 is strictly positive.
  $ aslref div-by-param.asl
  ASL Dynamic error: Illegal application of operator DIV for values 5 and 2.
  [1]

Examples with multiple constraints in slices:
  $ aslref div-multi-slices.asl

  $ aslref div-multi-slices-zero.asl
  File div-multi-slices-zero.asl, line 6, characters 10 to 17:
    let z = x DIV y;
            ^^^^^^^
  Warning: Removing some values that would fail with op DIV from constraint set
  {0, 1, 2} gave {1, 2}. Continuing with this constraint set.

Example with constant:

  $ aslref div-constants.asl
  File div-constants.asl, line 3, characters 22 to 29:
  constant z: integer = x DIV y;
                        ^^^^^^^
  ASL Static error: Illegal application of operator DIV for values 1 and 2.

Other example from typing.t:
  $ aslref --no-exec TNegative9-1.asl
  File TNegative9-1.asl, line 3, characters 4 to 59:
      let testB : bits(N) = Zeros{N DIV 4} :: Zeros{N DIV 2}; // bits(3N/4) != bits(N)
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  ASL Typing error: a subtype of bits(N) was expected,
    provided bits(((3 * N) DIV 4)).
  [1]
  $ aslref --no-exec TPositive9.asl

Other polynomial equations:
  $ aslref rat-poly-00.asl
  File rat-poly-00.asl, line 15, characters 9 to 19:
    assert c == '000';
           ^^^^^^^^^^
  ASL Typing error: Illegal application of operator == on types bits((7 DIV 2))
    and bits(3).
  [1]

  $ aslref rat-poly-01.asl
  ASL Dynamic error: Cannot extract from bitvector of length 0 slice 0+:-2.

Division as POW:
  $ aslref zero-pow-neg.asl
  ASL Dynamic error: Illegal application of operator ^ for values (0.0 / 1.0)
    and -1.
